#need to get:
#   method for counting anti-free-lunch-ist speeches given in congress by senator/rep
#   database of congressional gifts received OR
#   database of money spent dining lobbyists (free DINNER also counts, eh? ha)
#   or both.
#   plan for how to visualize (maybe d3py instead, if you feel like learning that; something like a McDouble that grows or shrinks based on how much money was spent or received on free lunches)
