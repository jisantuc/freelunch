Free lunch values received and given out vs. anti-free-lunch-ist speech

Need to get:
-   list of all senators by weird id thing sunlight uses
#-   list of phrases to search for "anti-free-lunch-ism" attitudes going to make these up probably, or solicit feedback from people and see which words show up most frequently
-   info on whether movie-review based sentiment analysis is a decent port to political speech
-   method for counting anti-free-lunch-ist speeches given in congress by senator/rep
-   database of congressional gifts received OR
-   database of money spent dining lobbyists (free DINNER also counts, eh? ha)
-   or both.
-   plan for how to visualize (maybe d3py instead, if you feel like learning that; something like a McDouble that grows or shrinks based on how much money was spent or received on free lunches)
